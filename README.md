# leaflet-challenge

From this link: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php, I chose the data set for the past 7 days and for M4.5+ Earthquakes. Based on the current Earthquake data, I centered my map on Nairobi, Kenya, with a zoom level of 2 so that almost all the earth is visible.
