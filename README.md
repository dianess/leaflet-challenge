From this link: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php, I chose the data set for the past 7 days and for M4.5+ Earthquakes (i.e. earthquakes of magnitude 4.5 & higher). Based on the current Earthquake data, I centered my map on Nairobi, Kenya, with a zoom level of 2 so that almost all the earth is visible when arriving on the page.

A user has the choices of a street map, a dark map, or a satellite map to view the earthquakes from the data set above. The user can turn off the earthquake option.

The legend describes the different colored circles based on earthquake magnitude. On the map, the size of the circles also corresponds to the earthquake magnitude, where larger and darker circles are those with higher magnitudes.
